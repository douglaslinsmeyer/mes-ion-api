# MES ION API Project Plan

## Executive Summary

The MES ION API (`mes-ion-api`) is a new microservice that will serve as the centralized integration layer between MES applications and Infor ION APIs. This service will handle authentication, request routing, data transformation, and provide a unified interface for all Infor ION interactions.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
- Centralize all Infor ION API integrations in a single, maintainable service
- Abstract ION complexity from MES applications
- Provide consistent authentication and error handling
- Enable monitoring and auditing of all ION interactions
- Support both synchronous API calls and asynchronous ION events

### Key Stakeholders
- MES Development Team
- ERP Integration Team
- Operations Team
- Security Team

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| ION API changes | High | Medium | Version detection, backward compatibility |
| Authentication complexity | High | Low | Thorough testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Caching, connection pooling |
| Data mapping errors | Medium | High | Comprehensive validation, testing |

### Project Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Clear requirements, phased approach |
| Resource availability | Medium | Medium | Cross-training, documentation |
| Integration delays | Medium | Low | Early ION environment access |

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical Success**
   - All MES applications use mes-ion-api for ION integration
